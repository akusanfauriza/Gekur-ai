Hello this is my ai team project, a calorie calculator that can predict your BMI and help you in building muscle.
Build using C++

# How to Run ?

Install dev C++ on your computer, open ngotot-ai.cpp navigate tou your bar search "Compile & Run", if theres a error maybe you should change "system(clear)" to "system(cls)"
